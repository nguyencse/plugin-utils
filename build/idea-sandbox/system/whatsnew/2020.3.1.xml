              <p>We have changed the version numbering system for Android Studio to more closely
              align with <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, the IDE upon
              which Android Studio is built.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>In the previous numbering system, this would have been Android Studio 4.3.
              With the new numbering system, it is now
              Android Studio Arctic Fox | 2020.3.1.

              is a modern toolkit for building native Android UI. The toolkit also brings all of
              Kotlin's benefits, such as helping you to write concise and idiomatic code that's
              fully interoperable with Java.
              <br><br>
              When using Android Studio to develop your app with Jetpack Compose, you benefit from

            <p>You can now inspect layouts
            written with the new Android declarative UI framework, Jetpack Compose. Whether
            your app uses layouts fully written in Compose or layouts that use a hybrid of
            Compose and Views, the Layout Inspector helps you understand how your layouts
            are rendered on your running device.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            To get started, deploy your app to a connected device and then open the
            <b>Layout Inspector</b> window by
            selecting <b>View > Tool Windows > Layout Inspector</b>. If the Layout Inspector
            doesn't automatically connect to your app process, select the desired app
            process from the process pulldown. You should soon see your app's layout
            rendered in the tool window. To get started inspecting your Compose layout,
            select the layout component visible in the rendering or select it from the
            <b>Component Tree</b>.

          <section>
            <![CDATA[
              <p>You can now easily export databases, tables, and query results from the
              <a href="https://d.android.com/studio/inspect/database">Database Inspector</a> to save, share, or recreate
              locally. When you open up an app project in Android Studio and inspect the
              app for that project in the Database Inspector, you can start exporting data
              in one of the following ways:</p>
              <br />
              <ul>
              <li>Select a database or table in the <strong>Databases</strong> panel and click
              <strong>Export to file</strong> <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/db-inspector-export-button.png" width="19" height="19">
              near the top of the panel.</li>
              <li>Right-click on a database or table in the <strong>Databases</strong> panel and select
              <strong>Export to file</strong> from the context menu.</li>
              <li>When inspecting a table or query results in a tab, click
              <strong>Export to file</strong> <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/db-inspector-export-button.png" width="19" height="19">
              above the table or query results.</li>
              </ul>
              <br />

              <p>After selecting an export action, you should see the <strong>Export</strong> dialog to help
              you through the final steps, as shown below. Depending on whether you are
              trying to export a database, table, or query results, you have the option of
              exporting the data in one or more of the following formats: DB, SQL, or CSV.</p>

        <stepElement>
          <section>
            <![CDATA[
            For Kotlin apps that use coroutines, you can now use
            <code>StateFlow</code>
            objects as a data binding source to automatically notify the UI about
            changes in the data. Your data bindings will be lifecycle aware and
            will only be triggered when the UI is visible on the screen.
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>To use a <code>StateFlow</code> object with your binding class, you need to specify a
            lifecycle owner to define the scope of the <code>StateFlow</code> object, and in your
            layout, assign the properties and methods of your <code>ViewModel</code> component to
            the corresponding views using binding expressions, as shown in the following
            snippets:
            </p>
            <br />
<pre>
class ViewModel() {
   val username: StateFlow<String>
}
</pre>
          <br />
<pre>
&lt;TextView
    android:id="@+id/name"
    android:text="@{viewmodel.username}" /&gt;
</pre>
          <br />
          <br />
            <p>If you're in a Kotlin app that uses AndroidX, <code>StateFlow</code> support is
            automatically included in the functionality of data binding, including the
            coroutines dependencies.

              <p>You can now compile up to Java 11 source code in your app’s

            from the menu bar. When you deploy an app using WorkManager <code>2.5.0</code> or

            workers in the <b>Background Task Inspector</b> tab.

            <p>To help you investigate issues from workers that fail execution, you can stop
            a currently running or enqueued worker by selecting it from the table and
            clicking <b>Cancel Selected Worker</b> <img src="https://d.android.com/studio/images/buttons/workmanager-cancel.png" />
